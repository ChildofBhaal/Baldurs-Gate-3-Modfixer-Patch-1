# Baldurs Gate 3 Modfixer Patch 1

While Larian has been telling the users the mods will work after their newest patch, there are still many mods which won't work with the latest release. I have created this patch, fixed right after the Patch 1 (08.25.2023). Link: https://forums.larian.com/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=886463

The mod corrects their mistakes.  Also contains: Story error remover and Improved UI compatible.

The mod doesn't need another mod fixer.

Install:
Download. Make a *.pak. While I never used the Vortex mod manager, but I made it to vortex ready, I still recommend the BG3 Mod Manager or manual install.

Please DO NOT copy my mod, DO NOT upload it elsewhere.

Regards,

Bhalan.
